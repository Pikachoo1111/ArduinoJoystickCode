# ArduinoJoystickCode

This code requires an Arduino Uno with a joystick. Connect the two data wires to the Arduino pins A0 and A1. Connect the button wire from the joystick to the digital pin 2 on the Arduino. In the python script, there is a port that needs to be set to the correct port that the Arduino is plugged into.
